# Fully-Bayesian data analysis of heights' distribution in families

This project presents a comprehensive Bayesian analysis of the distribution of children's heights in families, focusing on the influence of parents' heights. Utilizing Galton's classic data, it introduces various models, including pooled, hierarchical, and hierarchical models with parental prior mean, to study height distributions. 

The analysis incorporates Bayesian statistical methods to explore familial height dynamics, emphasizing understanding the genetic and environmental factors that contribute to height variation within families.
